# ‚úÇÔ∏è ClipSync

**ClipSync** is a lightweight, python-based cross-platform clipboard synchronization tool that allows multiple devices to share clipboard contents seamlessly over a network.

## üí° Motivation

As a cyber-threat researcher, I often need to synchronize the clipboards of multiple machines during investigations and research.  
After struggling with overly complex and bloated solutions for such a simple task, I decided to build my own lightweight, no-fuss tool ‚Äî **ClipSync**.

## üöÄ Features

- üîÑ Real-time clipboard syncing across devices.
- üî¶ Client/Server architecture inspired from [clipshare](https://github.com/reu/clipshare).
- ‚ùå Currently only supports text (Image and file support coming soon).
- üìã Multi-device support: all connected devices share virtually share a common clipboard.
- üíª Simple UI: Clean terminal interface implemented using [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual).
- üêç Minimal dependencies: `pyperclip`, `textual`.

## üì¶ Installation

### üìå Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `pip`
- `python-venv`

- NOTE: `pyperclip` on linux-based devices requires `xclip` to run

```bash
sudo apt-get install xclip
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Build from source

> It is recommended to install clipsync inside a virtual environment to not break any dependencies on your machine and not having to make any changes to your PATH environment variable.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate # or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
git clone https://github.com/lokallost/clipsync.git
cd clipsync
python -m pip install .
```
---

## üë• Usage

Run from the terminal using the `clipsync` command.

### Start the Server

```bash
clipsync server
```

Starts the sync server on default port `65432`.

### Start a Client

```bash
clipsync client <server_ip>
```

Once the client is connected to the server, the clipboard of the client is synced to the server.
